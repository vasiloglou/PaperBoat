/**
 * @file example.h
 * @brief This file gives examples of how to load a table
 *        and use it.
 *
 * Table is a highly templatized structure that can handle different
 * precisions and modes (sparse or dense). We have instantiated a couple
 * of combinations for ease of use.
 *
 * @code
 *  #include "fastlib/table/default/categorical/labeled/balltree/table.h"
 *  #include "fastlib/table/default/dense/labeled/balltree/table.h"
 *  #include "fastlib/table/default/dense/labeled/kdtree/table.h"
 *  #include "fastlib/table/default/dense_categorical/labeled/balltree/table.h"
 *  #include "fastlib/table/default/dense_sparse/labeled/balltree/table.h"
 *  #include "fastlib/table/default/sparse/labeled/balltree/table.h"
 *  // for dense data with double precision and a kdtree as an index use
 *  fl::table::dense::labeled::kdtree::Table table;
 *  // for sparse data with double precision and a balltree as an index use
 *  fl::table::sparse::labeled::balltree::Table table;
 *  // for categorical data with bool precision and a balltree as an index use
 *  fl::table::categorical::labeled::balltree::Table table;
 *  // for mixed data with dense double precision and categorical and a balltree as an index use
 *  fl::table::dense_categorical::labeled::balltree::Table table;
 * @endcode
 *
 * As a note the categorical data are represented as sparse booleans.
 * 
 * Now we will show an example of how to load the table from a file. For the file format
 * @sa http://www.ismion.com/documentation/file_formats.html
 *
 * @code
 *  fl::table::dense::labeled::kdtree::Table table;
 *  table.Init("myfile.txt", "r");
 *  // now read data from the table:
 *  fl::table::dense::labeled::kdtree::Table::Point_t point;
 *  for(index_t i=0; i<table.n_entries(); ++i) {
 *    // get an alias on the point of the table
 *    table.get(i, &point);
 *    // Any change we do on the point is reflected back on the table
 *    // point is not a local copy
 *    for(int j=0; j<point.size(); ++j) {
 *      double a=point.get(j);
 *      point.set(j, a+1);
 *    }
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you want to load the table with data you can use the following code
 *
 * @code
 *  fl::table::dense::labeled::kdtree::Table table;
 *  index_t dimension=10;
 *  index_t number_of_points=1000;
 *  table.Init("myfile", // this is a filename, if you want to save the table later
 *             std::vector<index_t>(1, dimension), // this vector is a list of
 *                                                 // the dense dimensions.
 *                                                 // The table can have several precisions
 *                                                 // In this particular case this table
 *                                                 // has been templatized to have only
 *                                                 // one precision (double), so the vector
 *                                                 // can have only one elements
 *             std::vector<index_t>(), // this vector has the sparse dimensions,
 *                                     // in general the table can several precisions
 *                                     // in this particular case the table is designed
 *                                     // to have only one dense precision and not sparse
 *                                     // ones, that is why the vector is empty
 *             number_of_points);
 *           
 *  // Now we can load the table
 *  fl::table::dense::labeled::kdtree::Table::Point_t point;
 *  for(index_t i=0; i<table.n_entries(); ++i) {
 *    table.get(i, &point);
 *    // set every element of the point to something like i+j  
 *    for(index_t j=0; j<point.size(); ++j) {
 *      point.set(j, i+j);
 *    }
 *  }
 *  // At this point the table is loaded  
 * @endcode
 *
 * As a note if we had sparse data this is how we would initialize the table
 * @code
 *  fl::table::sparse::labeled::balltree::Table table;
 *  index_t dimension=10000;
 *  index_t number_of_points=10000;
 *  table.Init("myfile", // this is a filename, if you want to save the table later
 *             std::vector<index_t>(), 
 *             std::vector<index_t>(1, dimension), 
 *             number_of_points);
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The table is labeled which means that except for the data in every dimension it also
 * carries metadata for every point. Metadata does not participate in linear algebra
 * operations. Every point carries three numbers (a signed char, a double and an int)
 * that hold extra information. For example the signed char can be used to store
 * class information, double for an associated value and int as an identifier. To access
 * them use the following syntax:
 *
 * @code
 *  fl::table::dense::labeled::kdtree::Table table;
 *  fl::table::dense::labeled::kdtree::Table::Point_t point;
 *  table.get(0, &point);
 *  signed char a=1;
 *  point.meta_data().template get<0>()=a;
 *  a=point.meta_data().template get<0>();
 *  double b=0.34;
 *  point.meta_data().template get<1>()=b;
 *  b=point.meta_data().template get<1>();
 *  int c=1314;
 *  point.meta_data().template get<2>()=c;
 *  c=point.meta_data().template get<2>();
 * @endcode
