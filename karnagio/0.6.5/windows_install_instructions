These are instructions for building binaries in windows


For windows we support MinGW32 for the moment

Download and install MinGW
Install CMake too
checkout the code from the mercurial let say inside C:\ismion\PaperBoat etc


open the file C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab
and add this line so that you can mount the development directory on MSYS so that you can access it from the
shell prompt
C:\ismion /ismion

Build lapack
Download lapack
do not use cmake to build it
Start the msys command prompt and go to the Lapack directory and do make Blas and then Make Lapack
rename the libraries to libblas.a and liblapack.a and copy them in /lib

Build Boost
download boost (we tried 1.46)
use bjam to build it
Download bjam and put it inside the unzipped boost directory
I found some good instructions that sort of work
http://cleardefinition.com/page/Build_Boost_for_MinGW/
try 
bjam --toolset=gcc --with-program_options --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-random --with-system --with-thread stage
then copy the boost directory that hass all the headers to /include. also go into stage/lib and copy all the libraries to 
/lib

Build Trilinos
Download trilinos
make another directory called trilinos.build in the same level with the unzipped trilinos directory

then goto trilinos.build and run
 
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -D Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=OFF \
-D Trilinos_ENABLE_Anasazi:BOOL=ON -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Epetra:BOOL=ON          \
 -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Teuchos:BOOL=ON -D Trilinos_ENABLE_AztecOO:BOOL=ON        \
-D BLAS_LIBRARY_DIRS:STRING=/lib  -D TPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES:STRING=/lib/libblas.a \
-D TPL_LAPACK_LIBRARIES:STRING=/lib/liblapack.a                               \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/ ../trilinos-10.6.2-Source

then do a make install

This will sort of mess your installation directory as it will throw all the trillinos headers (and more)
inside the /include
Goto the /include and make a directory /include/trilinos and copy all the trilinos headers in there

Build paperboat
if everything went well then all you have to do is a 
make config-debug and then cd into debug.build and build the targets as usual
